# Fast Click

Commands are registered immediately instead of waiting to see if it is an area command - which means you have no area commands.  Hold ALT to escape back to standard commands.

Not applied to build mode, in order to preserve lines, areas, and facing.  Patrol command is also excepted, since I almost universally use the area version.  Feedback welcome.
